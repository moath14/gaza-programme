## Founders & Coders Contributing and Decision Making Process  
**Approved:** February 2017 

### WHY do we need a process?

You have a question or idea and want to know what other members think about it. 

Our community needs a democratic decision-making process that facilitates collection action.

### WHAT to do to prepare a proposal for vote:

**NOTE:** This process applies to _both_ whole-group decisions _and_ decisions make within committees.

Post an issue and label it as a `discussion`. Both associate members and members of Founders & Coders are encouraged to contribute to discussions.

**When and if the discussion requires action steps:**

1. Draft a proposal using the WHY, WHAT, HOW format
1. Post in it a new issue
1. Label it as `proposal`
1. Assign it to a future business meeting (no sooner than one week in advance)

**Before the Meeting:**

- Community members can post requests for clarification as comments on the issue. Counter or conflicting proposals should be posted as separate proposals following the same format, with a link to the original proposal.
- The proposal maker should post a revised proposal (as an edited top comment) to address requests for clarification (if necessary).

### HOW to conduct a business meeting:

**Business meetings are for:**
- Discussing and voting on proposals (brought by both individuals and committees)
- Voting in new members
- Financial reporting
- Task group reports (time permitting) 

**Before beginning a meeting:**
- Arrange seating in a _circle_ so everyone can see each other during the discussions.
- Facilitator posts an agenda as a list of linked issues, in the order they will be discussed. 

**Facilitator (chosen at end of previous meeting) assigns roles:**
- `Time keeper` paces the 30 minute period allocated to each proposal
- `Record keeper` for each proposal
- `Vote counter` takes attendance and records votes
- `Tech` responsible for monitoring Hangouts and casting
- `Mood monitor` suggests breaks, checks on anyone who leaves

---

### Proposal ratification process:

_Discussion_ (up to 25 minutes):

- The person making the proposal reads it aloud in its entirety.
- The facilitator opens the floor to questions on each section (WHY, WHAT, HOW) in turn.
- If modifications are minor, the proposal maker can direct the record keeper to comment on the issue with the suggested changes.
- After discussion concludes, the facilitator reads the proposal and the comments aloud.
- If the proposal maker deems the suggested changes too significant, the proposal maker may request to table the vote until the following meeting in order to have time to draft a revised proposal.

_Voting_ (approximately 5 minutes):

- The facilitator calls the vote. Members may vote yay, nay, or abstain from voting. _Abstaining_ is a way to indicate that you aren't fully in support but don't want to block the issue. 
- Proposals will pass with unanimity (checkpoint on whether this is working to be taken at 6 months); proposals that do not pass can be revised and re-proposed at future meetings
- If the proposal is approved, the original proposal maker will draft a final version of the approved proposal, title it with the proposal name, and create a pull request to commit the file to the appropriate repository. 
- Once the document has been reviewed, the original proposal maker can close the related discussion and proposal issues.
